1. Sometimes you aren't able to run the webpage on your [Local Host](http://localhost:3000), in such cases, do the following:
   1. Exit open webpage.
   
   2. Exit terminal.

   3. Install all the packages listed under [2.0.2. Install Dependencies](#202-install-dependencies) section.

2. There is a random white box that is can be generated based on your screen resolution.
   
3. When visualizing two mutual funds simultaneously, if their relative values differ significantly, the graph may appear as a nearly straight line.


# 6. RoadMap Ahead

- [ ] Integrate login details with Supabase for tracking user history and enabling personalization
- [ ] Implement machine learning features to simplify mutual fund selection
- [ ] Deploy as a mobile app (App Store and Play Store)
- [ ] Allow users to input their portfolio and export it as CSV or PDF
